Never think that your hours of play

Those special memories of you  
Will always bring a smile  
If only I could have you back  
For just a little while  
Then we could sit and talk again  
Just like we used to do  
you always meant so very much to me  
and always will do too  
The fact that you're no longer here  
will always cause me pain  
but you're forever in my heart  
Until we meet again
